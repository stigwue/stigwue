# About

I work at making magic possible. Arthur Clarke postulated that _any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic_. I work at building the blocks that make waving around a wand work in Nigeria: some of it in education, a lottery stint, social health and distribution of especially consumer packaged goods.

I also go by the _Schr√∂dinger's Boss_ moniker, that teacher-learner duality? Yes.

## Others

I write. No, I am not going to tell you my pseudonym but [The Boolean Life](https://boolean.substack.com) has a few thoughts I sometimes catch myself expressing to friends.
